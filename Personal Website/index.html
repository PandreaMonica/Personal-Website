            <p>Allow me to introduce myself</p>
            <p>I graduated from the Transilvania University of Brasov, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Automation and Applied Informatics Department. Although I had the opportunity to work with several technologies and programming languages, web design remained by far my favorite. I was passionate about web designing since high school, because is part of the creative arts and requires me to explore my own creativity and imagination along with my technical knowledge.
            Therefore, I created this web portofolio in order to present my tehnical skills and my personality. What people see on my website will help them create an immediate feeling about who I am and what I can do.</p>
